## Classification Project
### Telco - Why are customers churning?

#### Goal:
- Find out why customers are churning
- Use data science

#### Questions the boss is interested in:
- When are customers most likely to churn? 
- Which features affect churn the most?
- Is there a price threshold that increases churn per feature?
- What does the churn rate look like after the 12th month?

#### Deliverables: 
- Report in a jupyter notebook with questions answered
- CSV with customer id, probability of churn, & prediction of churn
- Google slide deck 
    - show model
    - features used
    - how likely model gives a high probability of churn when no churn occurs
    - how likely model gives a low probability of churn when churn occurs
    - accuracy
- Oral presentation of google slides
- Multiple .py files with transformations to run model

#### Need to run: 
- Access to the bayes db on mysql
- Personal env.py file with host, user, & password

#### How to reproduce:
- Pull all .py files
    - util.py
    - acquire.py
    - prep.py
    - split_scale.py
- Add your env.py file
- Run through telco_pipeline.ipynb
    - Random states are set as 123 in the notebook
